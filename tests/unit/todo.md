# ToDo:
- Refactor the config manager class(es) to the correct locations and mock in a suitable way.
- Possibly move the conftest.py? Or create another high-level one with the correct stuff in it. Make the fixtures be in the right places and therefore more modular.
- Make sure all my unit tests have been written including all errors and edge-cases etc.
- When get back to my windows, try find a better way to mock Cosmos rather than Mongo to make it more similar to the deployed environment.
