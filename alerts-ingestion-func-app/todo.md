# ToDo
- Add the right amount of logging. Ensure I can easily switch logging.debug and logging.info and both work. Test in azure.
- Add better documentation for running locally and remote.
- Add better docstrings etc, tidy up the repo.
- Finish writing tests for this function app. Get full coverage, and ensure to think of every edge-case, test every exception, etc
