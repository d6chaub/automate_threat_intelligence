# Threat Intelligence Automation
## Purpose

The initial repository is offered by feedly as a way to make custom feedly integrations via API.

The goal of the threat intelligence automation project is to make an application that summarizes, contextualizes, and ranks security threat information from feedly. It will also write threats to azure devops as actionable items.
